    "#### Foreground processes\n",
    "A **foreground process** is different from a **background process** in 2 ways:\n",
    "1. Some foreground processes show an interface, through which the user can interact with the program. In Linux, the command line interface (CLI) is that user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The user must wait for one foreground process to complete before running another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background processes\n",
    "Unlike with a foreground process, the shell does not have to wait for a background process to end before it can run more processes. We can enter as many background commands one after another within the limit of the amount of memory available.\n",
    "\n",

The `done` marks the end of the loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The `CTRL-C` command\n",
    "We can use `CTRL-C` to kill a foreground process. To kill a background job, we must first bring it into the foreground `fg` and then type `CTRL-C`. It is simpler to use the `kill` command on the process. We can get a list of the running jobs with the `jobs` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Compare the outcomes of these commands\n",
    "Run this command: ```for i in `seq 1 100`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up a loop that runs from `1` to `100`, then it `sleeps` for a `second` (to slow it down). The `done` marks the end of the loop. While this is running, type `CTRL-C` and then `jobs` to see which jobs are running. We will not see any `jobs` in the list.\n",

    "Now, run it again: ```for i in `seq 1 100`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done```. While this is running, type `CTRL-Z` and then `jobs` to see which jobs are running. With `CTRL-Z`, the job is still there but stopped.\n",
